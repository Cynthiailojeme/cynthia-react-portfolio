        <h3>
          Iâ€™m Cynthia Ilojeme, a professional and highly skilled frontend
          developer. I am passionate about leveraging my diverse backgrounds to
          decipher challenging problems and create delightful experiences. I
          honed my skills at web development, and sometimes I dabble into
          technical writing as well as open source contribution.
          <br />
          <br />
          I develop websites with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I have top skills in
          using Javascript libraries like React JS and Vue JS to convert
          wireframes and designs into pixel perfect user interfaces.
          <br />
          <br />
          Being a diligent, hardworking and result oriented lady, I always work
          towards achieving best result on each project I lay my hands on.
