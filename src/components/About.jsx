        <h3>
          Iâ€™m Cynthia Ilojeme, a professional and talented Product Designer with
          front end development skills. I am passionate about leveraging my
          diverse backgrounds to decipher challenging problems and create
          delightful experiences. I honed my skills at web development, and
          sometimes I dabble into technical writing as well as open source
          contribution.
          <br />
          <br />
          I develop websites with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I have top skills in
          using Javascript libraries like React JS and Vue JS to convert
          wireframes and designs into pixel perfect user interfaces.
          <br />
          <br />
          Being a diligent, hardworking and result oriented lady, I always work
          towards achieving best result on each project I lay my hands on.
